      <p>At our ordinary monthly matches, we shoot one Classifier stage. A Super Classifier match is a special match held with the permission of USPSA HQ which includes 4 or more Classifier stages. Super Classifier matches are a great way to get classified in a new division (since 4 Classifiers is the minimum you need), or raise your classification in a division you don't often shoot. Sometimes competitors shooting a division they don't usually shoot are willing to lend out their usual gear to another competitor who wants to try something different. This is a great way to get a day's experience shooting Limited or Open without spending big bucks, so ask around!</p>
