      <p>
        Want to learn how to safely handle your pistol while moving, shooting
        through window ports, door ways, over or under tables, around walls.
        Start from a holster, or with your gun on a table, in a box, on a barrel,
        loaded or not loaded. Engage stationary targets, those that appear,
        appear/disappear, swing, rotate, you name it. Usually you shoot till you
        hit the target the correct number of times, regardless of how many shots
        it takes. Learn to always be aware of where your shots are impacting.

        Sound like fun? Come join a sport that provides excellent fun and
        training in safe gun handling. We have shooters from teens to 75 year
        olds. Fast and slow, but always safe, and usually smiling at the
        completion of a COF. It's great to see families enjoy the sport together.

        Practical Shooting, What is it? How do I participate?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is it?</b> Practical Shooting is a way to learn safe gun handling
        while having fun. Practical Shooting is primarily a pistol competition
        (there is also 3-gun competition-Rifle-Shotgun-Pistol) that is
        internationally recognized. The sanctioning bodies are USPSA (USA) and
        IPSC (International). Shooting involves handling pistols safely while
        moving to negotiate various props through out a course of fire (COF). A
        hallmark of such competition is that the COF is never the same. Exception
        is a classifier that is shot nationally for purpose of providing you a
        national class. Shooters compete against others of their same ability
        (class). You can approach the sport with intense competition or just use
        it as a way to improve your gun handling skills. A key focus of this
        competition is SAFETY. Strict gun handling rules apply and are enforced.
        All competition is under the direction of a Range Officer (RO) who is
        there to assure safety and to help new shooters to have fun while doing
        so safely.

        Targets include paper and reactionary targets such as steel plates and
        poppers. You may encounter paper targets that appear, appear/disappear,
        bob, swing. Distances range from close, a yard or two, up to 35 yards.
        Most targets are within 10-20 yards. For safety, steel in engaged at no
        less than 10 yds.

        <b>What equipment would I need?</b> Do I need expensive and fancy
        equipment? Not at all. There are several Divisions in which you can
        compete that are equipment based. The minimum required equipment to get
        started are safety glasses, ear protection, a safe Double action, safe
        action (Glock type), or single action (1911 type) pistol or a revolver, 9
        mm or larger caliber, and 2 or 3 extra magazines You need a holster that
        securely holds the gun, trigger guard must be covered when holstered, and
        magazine holders, usually one or two double pouches. The relatively
        inexpensive Kydex type holsters and mag holders are an excellent entry
        rig.

        The various divisions are OPEN (anything goes), Limited (iron
        sights-typical double stack magazines), Limited-10 (iron sights-single or
        double stack magazines loading maximum of 10 rds per magazine),
        Production (typical out of the box, nothing fancy, iron sights), Single
        Stack (classic 1911 pistols)... Typical COF is from 6 to 32 rounds so
        enough magazines to accommodate up to 32 rounds is adequate.. Good skills
        come with experience so we welcome and support the new shooter. Speed is
        not the focus, be smooth and safe, even walk the COF if you want. Compete
        against yourself and how smoothly you negotiate the COF.

        <b>How do I participate?</b> All shooters who have not previously shot
        this type of shooting must complete a safe shooter course during which
        you demonstrate you can safely draw your gun from a holster, control the
        muzzle during movement and reloading, and shoot accurately enough to keep
        all rounds fired within the appropriate impact area. Rules, scoring, and
        typical match protocol is explained. Each club has one or more safety
        officers who can get you started. Some do this check the day of the match
        but most clubs ask that it be done before. This allows more time to gain
        the knowledge needed to participate safely. To find participating area
        clubs and safety check contacts, access the Eastern Colorado Section web
        site at www.ecouspsa.com . You can shoot a match along the eastern slope
        nearly every week end. From near Fort Collins in the north, High Plains
        to the east, Pueblo to the south, Clear Creek to the west, Boulder in the
        center, And of course, Aurora which hosts a match twice a month (first
        Sunday and 4 th Sat), all year, weather permitting. All start times,
        locations, fees, and contact information can be found on the ECO web
        site.
